      <h1>Welcome<h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Hi! Thank you for checking out my Portfolio website. The process of building it was a lot of fun.
      I got to play around in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop and create things like that Border Collie above.
      Though I have picked up design and coding pretty quick, I am pretty new to the big world of User Experience Design.

      <h1>My Design Goals<h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        When I take up a new design project, I allways begin by thinking about the type of people I am designing for.
        I want my designs to humanize today's advanced technology, and to help people feel a sense of empowerment. Through
        exploring many passion projects, I've realized design is everywhere - the towns we live in, the parks we
        walk our dogs on, the plates we eat off of, and the screens we look at.
      </p>
      <h1>Why I'm interested in Design<h1>
      <p class="paragraph">I first became interested in design after reading a couple books on fashion design in Boarding School. I was always
            picking up new little side projects to do based on what I was reading at the time. For a couple months I was using the campus sewing
            room and learning how to
      make t-shirts and polos based on different things I saw in fashion books. I didn't learn about web design
      until my senior year when my roommate, who was running a non-profit, needed a website. Knowing I had a knack for
      picking up new projects, he asked if I'd be interested in helping out and the answer was "of course!". So I picked up
      a book on web development and eventually built him a website. The feeling of pulling ideas from my mind and bringing them
      to reality to help the people around me was indescribable. I was hooked on coding! My Freshman year of College I continued coding, building a search
      engine that landed me two interships that summer in software engineering and data science. Those interships taught me
      many things about working on an engineering team and communicating in a professional environment as well as new Design, Development,
      and Research skills. But, the biggest lesson I learned is that I don't like software engineering and data science as much as I thought I did.
      My favorite part about both interships was the design portion. And since then I have been exploring different projects in User Expereince Design.</p>
      <h1>I'm Also An Athlete<h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I am currently on the Mens Rowing Team at the the top Rowing program in the United States. Everyday, twice a day, I get to be around
        people who approach every goal in their life with their best effort, which is what brought them to our team. At our level, everyone is putting in 20 hour weeks
        in the gym and on the water year round. That means all of us have to do even the little things to the best of our ability, everyday. I take that approach
        into every goal I have on my list, in the boathouse and in life.
