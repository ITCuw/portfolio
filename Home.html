            <h3>My Design Goal</h3>
            <p>I want my designs to humanize today's advanced technology, and to help
              people feel a sense of empowerment. As a design intern at a local startup,
              I’ve learned design best practices and how to incorporate a company’s’
               vision into a new product.</p>

            <h3>Athlete Lifestyle</h3>
            <p>Every day, twice a day, I get to be around people who approach every goal
              in their life with their best effort. We are highly motivated, and high
              performing. I take that mentality into every goal I have on my list, in the boathouse,
              and in life.</p>

            <h3>Developer to Designer</h3>
            <p>I began my journey into the world of technology by building websites for
              non-profits, search engines for fun, and data dashboards as an intern. I’ve
              learned valuable lessons about working with clients, and I incorporate that
              into my design process.</p>
